# good_cache
`good_cache` is a Python library that caches the output of your functions. If your function has to read large files as its input or if it has to read files in a directory, and optionally some non-file function parameter values such as a str, int, bool, etc. values then `good_cache` can remember the input combination and return the ouput to the caller as long as the input combination has been seen (and cached) by `good_cache` previously.

### Here is an article that goes into some detail about `good_cache`:

### Here is the pip command to install it:
```
pip install good_cache
```


### Hereâ€™s a simple example of how you might use good_cache:

```
from good_cache import fs_files_cache

@fs_files_cache(files='filenames')
def sum_numbers_in_files(filenames):
    result = 0
    for filename in filenames:
        with open(filename, 'rt') as file:
            numbers = list(map(int, file.readlines()))
            result += sum(numbers)
    return result
```
